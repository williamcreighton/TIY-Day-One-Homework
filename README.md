Day 1 Homework
==============
Our Day 1 homework assignment at The Iron Yard was to build a basic website, taking the opportunity to explore HTML and CSS in addition to the intricacies of pushing code to GitHub. 

I used the assignment to rebuild the landing page for my iPad app, [Gardner's Sketch Book of the War][id], which faitfully recreates the Civil War photographer's 1866 photographic manuscript of the same name.
